# RockPaperScissors

### Intro

This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript

### What this Repo Contains

This repo will contain all the necessary notes and files to create a RockPaperScissors game

### roundwinTest
This file was created to independently test a script that would determine win conditions for a round of a game, using an seperate JavaScript script for this was very helpful in my workflow in completing this project

### style.css
Initially I wanted to create a stronger UI focused RockPaperScissors however for where I am at the current state (operating mostly within the console, proved to be more effective in completing the project in a timely manner)

### Features to be Added

As previously mentioned more UI focused functionality would be something that I would like to add in the future such as:
- Creating functionality for buttons as a means of entering in player choice
- Result printing in the form of alerts and ultimately the results printing to the page itself
- Creating a system which terminates the game based on number of wins vs number of rounds
